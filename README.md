## Collective effects in biphoton generation of a four-wave-mixing process (wavemixing_project)


The generation of biphotons remains an important field of research, as a number of applications require such sources. Some of their properties are fundamental for quantum information processing (boson sampling) and quantum communication (via quantum teleportation). One mechanism that allows for the production of paired photons is four-wave-mixing process (FWM), taking advantage of the  third-order nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(3)}$ effect. FWM processes in cold atomic ensembles have been employed to generate highly quantum-correlated photon pairs for the last fifteen years in several groups, although atomic interactions were typically disregarded. Recent experiments however have shown evidence of collective behavior in these types of systems. 


In this context, we seek to understand the contributions of dipole-dipole interactions in the generation of biphotons. To this end, we propose an ab initio model, where dipole-dipole interactions arise naturally to describe FWM in cold atomic clouds. Our simulations are consistent with recent experimental results and show evidence of collective behavior.
